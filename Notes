Wrap-up checklist:
- Would like a picture of a nothingburger. I can do that.
    Add to chapter 3.
- Chapter 3 videos:
    1: Plain JS debugging
    2: Video: transpiled debugging, no map file
    3: Video: transpiled debugging, with a map file


========================================



Still to cover:
- lambda functions --> go after chapter 6.
- const -> integrate with chapter 4
- string interpolation -> After chapter 6. Doing it before lambdas
- async programming
