# Introduction

Greetings and welcome to my humble book on TypeScript.

As I write these words, the front-end development community finds its popularity growing, its options bigger and wider than ever before and the opportunity to build truly amazing stuff just gets better every day. It's relatively easy to build front-end applications from an SDLC perspective and particularly when you compare your classic server-side SDLC experience.  At least one major framework pushes you hard into using TypeScript \(Angular\). Others provide TypeScript-friendly features or vice-versa. For instance, TypeScript benefits React development by supporting JSX. Many pure JS library authors have worked hard to provide TypeScript-friendly interfaces.  Let's back up this particular claim with some hard numbers:

I titled the book, Yet Another TypeScript Book because the market has given rise to several books, free and not-free. This hasn't stopped me from writing this one because I believe the market can bear another one[^1]. At the same time, different people learn things differently - more teaching "voices" help more people and at the end of the day, service to others motivates me quite a lot.

At the moment, there are several great resources for learning TypeScript, including the proto-iconic _TypeScript Deep Dive_, which you can read here: [http://basarat.gitbooks.io/typescript/](http://basarat.gitbooks.io/typescript/). It's a fine book and it's not the only available.

[^1]: Or at least, it can bear another free online book :\).
