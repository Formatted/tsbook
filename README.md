# Introduction - Why TypeScript?

Greetings and welcome to my humble book on TypeScript.

As I write these words, the JavaScript development community finds its popularity growing. Its tooling options are more numerous than ever before. Great tooling affords the community the opportunity to build truly amazing solutions on the front and back end. The opportunity landscape expands every day. These are exciting times!

The community's ranks are also growing. It's comparatively easy to build front-end applications versus your classic server-side experience \(think Java/.NET\). Some of those server-side devs from the .NET and Java world see this and want to jump up onto the bandwagon. At the same time, the entrance fee is quite low - newly minted developers can quickly build JavaScript solutions with minimal tooling and without the need for extravagant training[^1].

This is an age where we lucky few get to apply our intellect to these fascinating problem domains. Why should we complicate our lives and take time to learn about TypeScript?

For starters, at least one major framework \(Angular\) pushes you hard into using TypeScript. Others provide TypeScript-friendly features or vice-versa. For instance, TypeScript benefits React development by supporting JSX. Many pure JS library authors have worked hard to provide TypeScript-friendly interfaces.  Consider the DefinitelyTyped project:

I'll explain typings later in the book. At a high level, they help bridge the gap between TypeScript and pure JavaScript. I bring up the DefinitelyTyped github project because it shows a that a good-sized group of library developers and/or devotees think it's worth their time to create these typings. With over 3,000 contributors, almost 27k commits and pushing 10k stars - the project demonstrates that it's worth your while learning about this.

All of this is to say that TypeScript has and continues to gain traction in the JavaScript community. The jury is still out as to whether it will "win" and become the de facto scripting language of the web. It probably won't[^2]. But its appeal cannot be denied. A growing swath of current and future front end developers are choosing TypeScript over pure JavaScript.

I titled the book, Yet Another TypeScript Book because the market has given rise to several books, free and not-free. This hasn't stopped me from writing this one because I believe the market can bear another one[^3]. At the same time, different people learn things differently - more teaching "voices" help more people. At the end of the day, service of this sort to others provides sufficient motivation.

At the moment, there are several great resources for learning TypeScript, including the proto-iconic. _TypeScript Deep Dive_, which you can read here: [http://basarat.gitbooks.io/typescript/](http://basarat.gitbooks.io/typescript/). It's a fine book and I will refer to it often throughout.

[^1]: That's not to say that they are doing it well, but they are surely giving it a try.

[^2]: Given that JavaScript is already the "machine language of the web," we riches-embarrassed developers will be able to pick almost any language we want to use in the future and work seamlessly with everyone else.

[^3]: At least I think the market can bear another free, online book :\).
