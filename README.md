# Introduction

Greetings and welcome to my humble book on TypeScript.xx

As I write these words, the front-end development community finds its popularity growing, its options bigger and wider than ever before and the opportunity to build truly amazing stuff just gets better every day. It's relatively easy to build front-end applications from an SDLC perspective and particularly when you compare your classic server-side SDLC experience.  At least one major framework pushes you hard into using TypeScript \(Angular\) and others provide TypeScript-friendly . Many, many pure JS libraries have been convert to or at least made to be TypeScript-friendly.  Let's back up this claim with some hard numbers:

At the moment, there are several great resources for learning TypeScript, including the proto-iconic _TypeScript Deep Dive_, which you can read here: [http://basarat.gitbooks.io/typescript/](http://basarat.gitbooks.io/typescript/). It's a fine book and it's not the only available.
