# Introduction - Why TypeScript?

Greetings and welcome to my humble book on TypeScript.

As I write these words, the front-end development community finds its popularity growing. Its tooling options are more numerous than ever before. This great tooling affords the community the opportunity to build truly amazing solutions. The opportunity landscape seems to expand every day.

The community's ranks are growing. It's relatively easy to build front-end applications from an SDLC perspective compared to your classic server-side experience. Some of those server-side devs from the .NET and Java world see this and want to get on the bandwagon. 

At least one major framework pushes you hard into using TypeScript \(Angular\). Others provide TypeScript-friendly features or vice-versa. For instance, TypeScript benefits React development by supporting JSX. Many pure JS library authors have worked hard to provide TypeScript-friendly interfaces.  Let's back up this particular claim with some hard numbers:

![](/assets/DefinitelyTypeAsOf2017_03_05.png)I'll explain typings later in the book. At a high level, they help bridge the gap between TypeScript and pure JavaScript. I bring up the DefinitelyTyped github project because it shows a pretty solid group of library developers and/or devotees think it's worth their time to create these typings. Over 3,000 contributors, almost 27k commits and pushing 9,000 stars - this is a a good bit of smoke and evidence that it's worth your while learning about this.

I titled the book, Yet Another TypeScript Book because the market has given rise to several books, free and not-free. This hasn't stopped me from writing this one because I believe the market can bear another one[^1]. At the same time, different people learn things differently - more teaching "voices" help more people and at the end of the day, service to others motivates me quite a lot.

At the moment, there are several great resources for learning TypeScript, including the proto-iconic[^2] _TypeScript Deep Dive_, which you can read here: [http://basarat.gitbooks.io/typescript/](http://basarat.gitbooks.io/typescript/). It's a fine book and I will refer to it often throughout.

[^1]: Or at least, it can bear another free online book :\).

[^2]: It may already be iconic, but TypeScript is still pretty low on the adoption curve. Give it enough time and it will be truly iconic.
