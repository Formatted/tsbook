# Introduction

Greetings and welcome to my humble book on TypeScript. You may be asking, "do we really need another book on TypeScript?" I have two answers to that question. First, "who cares?" I feel like doing it and so, I will ;\). More seriously \(but not \*much\* more seriously\), I say "yes" and this is where it gets mildly complicated. Why "yes?"

As I write these words, the front-end development community finds its popularity growing, its options bigger and wider than ever and the opportunity to build truly amazing stuff just gets better every day. At least one major framework pushes you hard into using TypeScript \(Angular\). Many, many pure JS libraries have been convert to or at least made to be TypeScript-friendly.  I can put some numbers behind this claim:



At the moment, there are several great resources for learning TypeScript, including the proto-iconic _TypeScript Deep Dive_, which you can read here: [http://basarat.gitbooks.io/typescript/](http://basarat.gitbooks.io/typescript/). It's a fine book and it's not the only available.
