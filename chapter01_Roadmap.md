# Topics

This book follows familiar conventions. It starts off with simple topics (variables and data types) and works its way up to more complicated topics towards the end. 

I'm using github and gitbook to author and deliver this content. Gitbook provides a handy navigation pane that should show up over on your left (unless you've hidden it). It updates automatically as I add, change or remove content. It's your best table of contents.

## The Gloss-Overs

This book doesn't go into any great detail about some topics.  For instance, the book does not provide step-by-step instructions for downloading TypeScript, installing it or configuring it. This and similar topics are covered in much better detail elsewhere.

This chapter will point you to a collection of web sites and blog posts that do a good job explaining such things. Keep in mind that TypeScript is newish. As a result, the community is still sorting out best practices. 

## Practical Considerations

This chapter covers the TypeScript development experience at a higher level. It answers questions such as:
- How do I write TypeScript applications in the first place?
- How does TypeScript run in the browser? (It doesn't, actually - it "transpiles" to JavaScript).
- How do I debug TypeScript?


## Introducing Types

TypeScript offers static types. You don't need to use them, but they are pretty helpful. This chapter starts off describing primitives (integers, strings and the like). It shows how declaring a variable's type helps good integrated development environments (IDEs) provide useful edit-time and compile-time feedback. We'll also take an opportunity to try and knock the TypeScript doubters off their perch with the strong typing goodness :). 

## Complex Types Using Interfaces

The real world is complicated with complex data structures. TypeScript offers up the notion of `interfaces` to help us describe and manage them. This chapter focuses on interfaces as data describers. It starts off by describing a complex, but flat object. It continues the discussion with a nested object and ends by showing how you can describe a complex REST response.
