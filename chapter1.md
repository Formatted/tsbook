# Roadmap

This book follows familiar conventions. It starts off with simple topics (variables and data types) and works its way up to more complicated topics towards the end. 

I'm using github and gitbook to author and deliver this content. Gitbook provides a handy navigation pane that should show up over on your left. It updates automatically as I add, change or remove content. It's your best table of contents.
