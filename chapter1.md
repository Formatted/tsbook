# Roadmap

This book follows familiar conventions. It starts off with simple topics (variables and data types) and works its way up to more complicated topics towards the end. 

I'm using github and gitbook to author and deliver this content. Gitbook provides a handy navigation pane that should show up over on your left (unless you've hidden it). It updates automatically as I add, change or remove content. It's your best table of contents.

## Topics

### The Gloss-Overs
This book doesn't go into any great detail about some topics.  For instance, the book does not provide step-by-step instructions for downloading TypeScript, installing it or configuring it. This and similar topics are covered in much better detail elsewhere.

### Practical Considerations
This section explains the whole TypeScript thing from a higher level. It answers questions such as:
- What is transpilation?
- How does TypeScript run in the browser?
- "How do I debug TypeScript?


### Variables and Simple Types
We'll start off with primitives (integers, strings) and take an opportunity to knock the  TypeScript doubters off their perch with the strong typing goodness :). 

### Moderately Complex Types

### Advanced Types
### Interfaces
### Introducing Classes
### Advanced Classes
### Named Functions and Lambda Functions
### Asynchronous Programming
