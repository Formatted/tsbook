# Roadmap

This book follows familiar conventions. It starts off with simple topics (variables and data types) and works its way up to more complicated topics towards the end. 

I'm using github and gitbook to author and deliver this content. Gitbook provides a handy navigation pane that should show up over on your left (unless you've hidden it). It updates automatically as I add, change or remove content. It's your best table of contents.

## Topics

### The Gloss-Overs
This book doesn't go into any great detail about some topics.  For instance, the book does not provide step-by-step instructions for downloading TypeScript, installing it or configuring it. This and similar topics are covered in much better detail elsewhere.

### Practical Considerations
This section explains the whole TypeScript thing from a higher level. It answers questions such as:
- What is transpilation?
- How does TypeScript run in the browser?
- How do I debug TypeScript?


### Variables and Simple Types
We'll start off with primitives (integers, strings and the like) and show how declaring a variable's type helps good integrated development environments (IDEs) provide useful edit-time and compile-time feedback. We'll also take an opportunity to try and knock the TypeScript doubters off their perch with the strong typing goodness :). 

### Moderately Complex Types Using Interfaces
We want to talk about much more advanced stuff than your basic integers, booleans and strings. In order to get there, we need to talk about interfaces.

### Introducing Classes
Important building block for OOP.
Properties
Methods


### Advanced Classes
Classes inheriting from classes
Abstract classes
Classes implementing interfaces

### Lambda Functions
() => { }

### Asynchronous Programming

Advanced Types
The `Type` statement
Type guards
Union types
Intersection types
The `object` type

### Pot luck
String interpolation
