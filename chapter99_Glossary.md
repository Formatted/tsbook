# Contributing to this Book

I think that most authors, and I count myself among them, derive immeasurable satisfaction from reader feedback. If you'd like to contribute to the book in a non-material, spiritual way, the easiest thing is to simply send me a note to galvin.paul@gmail.com. It would be helpful if you put the words "TypeScript Book" in the subject, but certainly isn't required. I always get a little extra pep in my step when someone leaves a comment on one of my blog posts or reaches out by email. It's better than being paid![^1].

I have long been impressed, interested and even a bit envious of the *You Don't Know JavaScript* series. Kyle Simpson obviously hit a nerve and he has a really thriving Github project going. I have, in fact, tried to follow his model. If you'd like to participate in a more material way, hit up this book's github site, https://github.com/pagalvin/tsbook:
- Star the project
- Log some issues
- Correct problems you find and issue a pull request
- Suggest and even write entire new areas of content and issue a pull request

I will make every effort possible to respond to your emails, review and manage github issues and honor high quality pull requests.
